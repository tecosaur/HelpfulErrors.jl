#+title: HelpfulErrors

Julia's errors are much less helpful than they could (or should, as some would say) be. Let's try to bridge the gap a bit.

This package is a prototype for functionality that I think should be in the Base
language. This isn't a complete solution, but I think it's a step in the right direction.

#+begin_src julia-repl
pkg> add https://github.com/tecosaur/HelpfulErrors.jl

julia> using HelpfulErrors

julia> "a" + "b"

ERROR: MethodError: no method matching +(::String, ::String)

Suggestion: To concatenate strings use the * operator not +, try "a" * "b".
Docs: For more information see manual/strings/#man-concatenation.
Note: If you're wondering why * is used over +, the short version is to respect
  that concatenation is non-commutative.
